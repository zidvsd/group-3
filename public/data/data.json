      "Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) is one of the biggest mobile games of today, also a staple within the esports world and certainly a massive game within Southeast Asia. As an avid writer and a student of the game, I was curious about the way MLBB has evolved and why it still appeals to millions. The game’s world championship series, known as the M-Series, has attracted an increasing number of viewers every year. The M2 World Championship in 2020 peaked at three million. By the M5 Championship in 2023, it had more than 5 million viewers. Esports Charts, a site that tracks esports stats, reported those numbers. As Alexey Borisov, the chief of esports editors at Esports Charts, notes, this isn’t the result of an overnight explosion.",
      "Its growth, he said, came from expanding into new territories, increasing the amount of prize money and starting new tournament series. These are the things that have helped MLBB grow into a global esports title.",
      "Southeast Asia plays a big role in this success. The Philippines and Indonesia, in particular, are countries that have contributed a lot to MLBB’s viewership. According to Borisov, Filipino and Indonesian languages are also being acknowledged in the esports scene. Little do we know that Indonesia is behind only English and Chinese, and Filipino appears to be entering in the top 10 soon.",
      "The support for MLBB from fans in Southeast Asia is really amazing. Families and friends often gather to watch the tournaments in these countries. Some streamers, content creators and influencers stream these games and they help build a stronger community. The esports scene in Southeast Asia is, perhaps, one of the most fervent parts of the globe, and that is putting it mildly.",
      "Borisov also pointed out that this is only the beginning. He believes that mobile esports has a lot more room to grow. Some of his predictions were stated in the impersonal passive voice, like “the audience will continue to grow” and “esports is expected to expand into new markets.” These ideas show that more people will likely be involved in MLBB and other mobile games in the future.",
      "In conclusion, MLBB is not an ordinary game. It’s a community, a competition and one that’s becoming increasingly mainstream in Southeast Asia. As students, we can learn how a simple mobile game that started small became a global hit by following trends, involving creators, and building strong regional support."

    "lead": "In a nation rich with languages and brilliant minds, why does the English language seem like a gatekeeper to progress?",
    "article": [
      "Within the raging turmoil of surviving on an ever-progressing global stage, Filipinos have always struggled to keep up. From the desperation of meeting the standards of developing countries to securing even the most basic necessities, the challenge of progress has never been easy.",
      "At the heart of it all is the English language — mandated from grade school to college, taught as a foundation for academic and professional growth. It’s the global standard. A minimum requirement. A survival tool. Yet for many, it’s seen as the language of snobs, the rich, the boastful. Elitist. Intimidating.",
      "And so the question lingers: is fluency in English truly a measure of intelligence or is it just a performance? Maybe even a social accessory?",
      "That debate reignited when a teacher from Northern Samar shared a Facebook post expressing their dismay over the results of a simple spelling quiz that was conducted during their Media and Information Literacy (MIL) class. What should have sparked concern was instead met with viral laughter and disbelief. Senior high school students who are the very youth on the edge of adulthood, struggled to spell even the most basic words.",
      "A telltale decline",
      "“Credit is joh.” One of many answers that made netizens scratch their heads and ask: How did we get here?",
      "At this stage in education, students are expected to be preparing for college, careers, and their lives beyond the classroom. But when they can’t spell the language used in college instruction, in job interviews, and in global forums—we’re forced to face an uncomfortable truth: we are failing them. And not just in spelling.",
      "What many miss in this conversation is how English has quietly become a cultural divide. Speak it well, and you’re labeled “intelligent.” The downside? You’re also “mayabang.” Struggle with it, and you’re “dumb,” but still more “relatable” in a laughable way. The language is no longer just a tool; it’s a status symbol. And worse, it’s one we weaponize against each other.",
      "A gap uncrossed",
      "The raw truth? Fluency has never equaled intellect. The Philippines, known for its richness in languages—from Tagalog to Waray, from Cebuano to Ilocano—intelligence has and will always thrive in all of them. Still, in a world that runs on English, not aligning with the global standard doesn’t make us less smart. Instead, it makes us less heard. And that silence has a cost.",
      "The progress we seek demands action. We need to stop laughing and start realizing that English doesn’t make someone superior nor smarter but neither should our discomfort with it stop us from learning. Because in a world that speaks in one language, being left out of the conversation is more dangerous than getting the spelling wrong."

      "A viral video sparked online involving a Toyota Tamaraw and a traffic officer led to a big misunderstanding of the driver being penalized for not having a “Not for Hire” sticker. The issue left many people with confusion and concern. With this issue, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) has clarified that private vehicles, especially pickup trucks and cargo carriers, are not required to display such stickers.",

      "MMDA Chair Atty. Romando Artes explained during a press briefing, that the traffic enforcer involved in the incident had made a mistake. The violation cited was colorum, which refers to the unauthorized use of a private vehicle for public transport, not the absence of a “Not for Hire” sticker. Chair Artes stated, “Ang violation po niyan, hindi po ‘not for hire.’ Ang violation po ay colorum,” emphasizing that the enforcer who issued the ticket had misinterpreted the offense of the owner of the private vehicle.",

      "The MMDA also confirmed that there is no policy under Republic Act No. 4136 that mandates a “Not for Hire” sticker on private registered vehicles. While a no ‘Not for Hire’ sign may appear in lists of traffic violations, it will only be applied to vehicles being used as a public transport. The agency clarified that any owner of a private vehicles who do not transport passengers for hire are not subject to this rule.",

      "According to the MMDA, private vehicle owners are under no obligation to display a “Not for Hire” sticker. Choosing to use, or not use, such signage should not result in penalties unless there is proof that the vehicle is being used for illegal passenger transport.",

      "In response to the error made, the MMDA announced that the officer involved would be relieved from duty and will face charges that are appropriate to the mistakes he has made.",

      "In a time where social media can quickly spread misunderstandings, this can serve as a wakeup call for both motorists and traffic enforcers to fully understand traffic regulations and prevent spreading information without knowing the full context of the provided issue.",

      "Rest assured, the issue was caused by a mistake in enforcement, not by any new law or policy. If you own a pickup truck or cargo vehicle, you don’t need to put a “Not for Hire” sticker. You can only be issued a ticket when there is a clear violation of illegal transport."
